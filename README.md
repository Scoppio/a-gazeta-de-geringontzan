## Meta Reports
Hearthstone is a fast paced game, with a professional league, world championship
and people earning money and fame thanks to it. But to further develop into the
game it is necessary to study real data to comprehend the meta-game and what to
expect of it in the next few days. Therefore a meta analysis on the game data is
necessary.

## A Gazeta
This project is meant to be an automated meta-analysis, divided into 3 steps
 - Collect Data from many different players
 - Once have a minimum amount of games per week, create automated meta-report
 - Apply predictive analysis in the data.

## Blizzard's API
Unfortunatelly Blizzard has never published the API for Hearthstone that it
promised, so I took my time and looked on the internet for someone that have
created a game-tracker and opened the database for others to use the data for
research. Long story short, there is NONE!

## Transparency
There is still a mindset that "transparency is bad for business", and all the
developers and holders of these databanks share this idea, but I do not. So I
started my own project

## Track-o-bot
Instead of creating a Hearthstone Log-parser, I decided to use a software that
is already quite famous, the Track-o-bot, it has many functionalities which
would take months for me to develop from ground on my own, so this allows me to
focus exclusivelly on my end of things.
